## 📚 Contributing

#### 🐎 Adding new ponies
If you wish to add new ponies to the project, please adhere to the following guidelines in order to maintain the project's structural integrity and functionality. The two main distinguishing features of these ponies are their size and style (e.g. Hat or Wings). Refer to the current pony ASCII art to determine the size of your new pony. If your pony is larger than the others, use the format `<ponyname>_large`. If the size is the same as an existing pony, find a visible difference between your pony and the current one, and name it `<ponyname>_<difference>_large`. If you are still unsure, please open an issue to discuss it with members of our team. Additionally, after adding a new pony, please ensure to credit the author in the "Sources" section of the README.

#### 🖥️ Modifying & Adding code
Ponyfetch is still under development, so it is likely that there are bugs present. If you encounter one, please open an issue and discuss it with us. Once the discussion is completed, submit a pull request with the proposed changes.
